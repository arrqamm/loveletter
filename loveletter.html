I know i'm winning in life because i have you and you are the greatest gift the universe has ever given me.</p>

    <p>I didn't fall in love with you. I walked into love with you, with my eyes wide open, choosing to take every step along the way. I do believe in fate and destiny, but i also believe we are only fated to do the things that we'd choose anyway. And i'd choose you n a hundred lifetimes, in a hundred worlds, in any version of reality, i'd find you and i'd choose you.</p>

I can't imagine my life without you now, and i dont ever want to. You have become the center of my universe, the reason for my smile, and the beat of my heart. I love you more than words can express, more than actions can show. You are my everything, i cannot imagine my days without you.</p>
